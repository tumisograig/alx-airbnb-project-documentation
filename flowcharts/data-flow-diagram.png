# Task 4: Design a Flowchart for a Key System Process

## Objective

Visualize the step-by-step workflow of a core backend process in the Airbnb Clone project by creating a flowchart.

## Chosen Process: User Registration

This flowchart will illustrate how the system handles a new user registration, from receiving user input to storing the new user in the database.

## Step-by-Step Instructions (Draw\.io)

1. **Open Draw\.io**

   * Go to [https://draw.io](https://draw.io).
   * Click **Create New Diagram** → **Blank Diagram** → **Create**.

2. **Enable Flowchart Shapes**

   * In the left panel, click **More Shapes...**.
   * Under **General**, check **Flowchart** and click **Apply**.

3. **Add Start Symbol**

   * Drag the **Terminator (Start/End)** shape onto the canvas.
   * Label it **Start**.

4. **Add Process Steps**

   * Drag a **Process** (rectangle) shape.
   * Label steps in order:

     1. `Receive registration request`
     2. `Validate input data`
     3. `Check if email exists`
     4. `Hash password`
     5. `Create user record`

5. **Add Decision Points**

   * Drag a **Decision** (diamond) shape for the email check.
   * Place between `Check if email exists` and next step.
   * Label with **Email exists?** and draw two outgoing arrows labeled **Yes** and **No**.

6. **Handle Outcomes**

   * If **Yes**, connect to a **Process** step labeled `Return error: email already used`.
   * If **No**, proceed to `Hash password`.

7. **Add End Symbol**

   * Drag another **Terminator** shape and label **End**.
   * Connect it from the final step `Create user record` and from the email error path.

8. **Connect Shapes**

   * Use the **Connector** tool to draw arrows between shapes following the process flow.

9. **Style & Arrange**

   * Arrange vertically: Start at top, End at bottom.
   * Use consistent arrow styles and shape sizes.

10. **Export as PNG**

* File → **Export As** → **PNG**.
* Check **Include a copy of my diagram**, export, and save as `user-registration-flowchart.png`.

## Saving to Repository

1. Create directory `flowcharts/` in your repo.
2. Add this `README.md` and your exported `user-registration-flowchart.png`.
